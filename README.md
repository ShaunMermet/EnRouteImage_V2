## Mission Objectives

UserFrosting seeks to balance modern programming principles, like DRY and MVC, with a shallow learning curve for new developers.  Our goals are to:

- Create a fully-functioning user management script that can be set up in just a few minutes
- Make it easy for users to quickly adapt the code for their needs
- Introduce novice developers to best practices such as separation of concerns and DRY programming
- Introduce novice developers to modern constructs such as front-end controllers, RESTful URLs, namespacing, and object-oriented modeling
- Build on existing, widely used server- and client-side components
- Clean, consistent, and well-documented code
